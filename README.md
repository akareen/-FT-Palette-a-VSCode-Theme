# FT Palette - A theme for VS Code

Inspired by the iconic and enjoyable reading experience of the Financial Times, the Financial Elegance theme brings a sense of sophistication and clarity to your coding environment. Whether you're deep in the trenches of the financial industry or crafting code in any other sector, this theme provides a visually pleasing palette that's easy on the eyes and conducive to productivity.

Personally I use this theme with Night Shift mode on my monitor to make coding even easier on the eyes, the color palette works well with the warmer tones of Night Shift but also works just as well with the default screen colors.
